# Paper Reproducibility Manifest

This file maps the manuscript's numerical claims and generated figures
to the saved artifacts produced by the paper pipeline.

## Full Data Stage

Run:

```bash
N_JOBS=128 ./paper/run_full_results.sh paper_eval_outputs/<run>
```

Smoke-test the same entrypoint with:

```bash
QUICK=1 N_JOBS=4 ./paper/run_full_results.sh paper_eval_outputs/<quick-run>
```

Primary outputs:

| Artifact | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `paper_eval_outputs/<run>/logs/main_evaluation.log` | Terminal log for the five-seed main evaluation. |
| `paper_eval_outputs/<run>/main_evaluation/campaign_summary.json` | Source for aggregate robustness claims and rule-of-three bound. |
| `paper_eval_outputs/<run>/main_evaluation/campaign_runs.csv` | Per-seed compact campaign table. |
| `paper_eval_outputs/<run>/main_evaluation/run_*_seed_*/summary.json` | Per-seed summaries, narrative scenarios, ablation rows, and runtime summaries. |
| `paper_eval_outputs/<run>/main_evaluation/run_*_seed_*/run_record.json` | Per-seed count-level records used to build aggregate summaries. |
| `paper_eval_outputs/<run>/main_evaluation/run_*_seed_*/stress_map_source.csv` | Cell counts and rates for the mixed-turn stress-map figure. |
| `paper_eval_outputs/<run>/main_evaluation/run_*_seed_*/near_threshold_default_margin_summary.csv` | Default-setting certification rates by near-threshold margin bin. |
| `paper_eval_outputs/<run>/logs/projection_sweep.log` | Terminal log for the deterministic projection sweep. |
| `paper_eval_outputs/<run>/projection_full/summary.json` | Source for uncapped projection-sensitivity summaries. |
| `paper_eval_outputs/<run>/projection_full/projection_rows.csv.gz` | Deterministic projection rows used to render the capped projection figure. |

The compact default deliberately does not write the full straight,
mixed-turn, or near-threshold row dumps. Those files are large and are
not needed to reproduce the manuscript figures or headline claims. Use
`paper.run_evaluation --row-output-mode all` only for forensic debugging.

## Rendering Stage

Run:

```bash
./paper/render_paper_figures.sh paper_eval_outputs/<run>
```

Rendered outputs:

| Manuscript item | Rendered artifact | Data source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mixed-turn stress maps | `rendered_figures/main/fig_stress_maps.pdf` | first per-seed run, `stress_map_source.csv` |
| Near-threshold ablation | `rendered_figures/main/fig_ablation.pdf` | first per-seed run, `summary.json` |
| Sampled-heuristic supplement figure | `rendered_figures/main/fig_sampled_proxy_miss.pdf` | first per-seed run, `summary.json` narrative scenario |
| Projection-sensitivity supplement figure | `rendered_figures/projection_deterministic_51_cap_100nmi/projection_min_error_vs_excursion.pdf` | `projection_full/projection_rows.csv.gz` filtered to 100 NMI |
| Versioned projection artifact | `paper/results/projection_deterministic_51_cap_100nmi.tar.gz` | Capped projection rendering stage |
| Full run archive | `paper/results/<run>.tar.gz` | Complete compact data and rendered figure run |

## Claim Sources

| Claim family | Source artifact |
| --- | --- |
| Straight-heading exactness | `main_evaluation/campaign_summary.json` and `run_*/summary.json` |
| Mixed-turn false-safe / false-unsafe counts | `main_evaluation/campaign_summary.json` and `run_*/run_record.json` |
| Five-seed robustness and rule-of-three bound | `main_evaluation/campaign_summary.json` |
| Near-threshold certification rate | first per-seed `summary.json` and `campaign_summary.json` |
| Near-threshold certification by margin bin | first per-seed `near_threshold_default_margin_summary.csv` |
| Runtime summary | first per-seed `table_4_runtime_summary.csv` and all per-seed `summary.json` files |
| Projection disagreement and ambiguity-band counts | `paper/results/projection_deterministic_51_cap_100nmi.tar.gz` |

## Schematic Figures

The application schematic and clearance-grid figure are explanatory
manuscript figures rather than stochastic experiment outputs. They are
generated from the manuscript repository scripts and are not required for
checking the empirical claims above:

| Manuscript figure | Script |
| --- | --- |
| Lateral overlap schematic | `scripts/render_lateral_overlap_figure.py` in the manuscript repository |
| Clearance grid | `scripts/render_clearance_grid_figure.py` in the manuscript repository |
