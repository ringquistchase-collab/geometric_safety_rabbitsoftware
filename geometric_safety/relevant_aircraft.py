"""
Relative-aircraft catch-up projection using convex geometry.

Plain-language overview
-----------------------
This module asks a practical controller-style question:

    "Given where two aircraft are now, where they are pointed, how fast they might be
    going, and how they may turn, can they possibly come too close within the next
    few minutes?"

The key idea is not to simulate one nominal future. Instead, we construct the entire
envelope of futures allowed by the model and then ask whether any member of that
envelope enters the protected separation region.

There are two versions of the calculation:

1. Straight-heading method
   If both aircraft keep a fixed heading, the full set of possible relative motions can
   be collapsed into one convex 2-D shape. The problem then becomes: how close can that
   shape come to the origin? Under its assumptions, this version is exact.

2. Turn-aware method
   If one or both aircraft are turning at a fixed rate toward a target heading, the
   possible relative positions still form a simple convex shape at any one chosen time,
   but that shape changes over time. The method therefore:
   - computes the exact worst-case distance at selected times,
   - certifies whole time intervals using an interval-local bound on how fast the
     reachable hull can move,
   - and treats any interval that cannot be certified finely enough as unsafe.

In short:

    straight flight -> one exact geometric check,
    turning flight -> many exact geometric checks plus a conservative time certificate.

This means the turn-aware version is intentionally cautious: it should only say "safe"
when the whole modelled time horizon has been certified safe. The public API also
offers an optional additional robustness buffer for in-turn speed variation beyond the
core constant-speed turn model.

Formal statement
----------------
The remainder of this docstring recasts the same idea in a more formal style.

The underlying question is:

    Given two aircraft states now, bounded speed uncertainty, and a finite horizon
    [0, T], can any admissible motion bring the aircraft closer than a required
    separation distance D?

Both public methods answer that same decision problem, but under different kinematic
models:

1. `catch_up_projection_interval`
   Exact for fixed headings and bounded constant speeds.
2. `catch_up_projection_interval_with_turns`
   Exact in speed and conservative in time when each aircraft may execute one fixed-rate
   turn toward a target heading and then continue straight.

The sections below are intended to bridge implementation and exposition: they define the
objects being optimised, explain why the straight-line method reduces to a single convex
projection, and explain why the turning method requires a certified search in time.


Problem statement
-----------------
Fix a local east/north tangent plane. Let

    p_A(0), p_B(0) in R^2

be the current aircraft positions, and define the initial relative position

    r_0 = p_A(0) - p_B(0).

Let each aircraft speed lie in a closed interval

    s_A in [s_A^-, s_A^+],   s_B in [s_B^-, s_B^+],

with speeds treated as constant over the projection horizon once chosen. The core
quantity of interest is

    d_* = min ||p_A(t) - p_B(t)||
          over t in [0, T] and all admissible speeds.

The safety decision is then simply:

    safe  <=>  d_* >= D.

So the aim is not to predict one nominal closest approach, but to bound the worst case
over an admissible envelope of motion.


Method 1: Straight headings
---------------------------
For the straight-line model, each aircraft has a fixed heading. If `u_A` and `u_B` are
the corresponding unit heading vectors, then

    p_A(t) = p_A(0) + t s_A u_A,
    p_B(t) = p_B(0) + t s_B u_B.

Hence the relative motion is

    r(t) = r_0 + t (s_A u_A - s_B u_B).

The set of admissible relative velocities is the image of the speed rectangle under an
affine map:

    V = { s_A u_A - s_B u_B : s_A in [s_A^-, s_A^+], s_B in [s_B^-, s_B^+] }.

Because the speed intervals are one-dimensional, `V` is the convex hull of the four
corner velocities obtained from the speed extremes. Over the full horizon, the set of
all admissible relative displacements is

    S(T) = { t v : t in [0, T], v in V }.

Since `V` is convex and contains all admissible relative velocities,

    S(T) = conv({0} union {T v_i}),

where `v_i` are the four extreme relative velocities. This reduces the continuous-time
reachability problem to a single compact convex polygon in displacement space.

The worst-case separation becomes

    d_* = min_{d in S(T)} ||r_0 + d||.

Equivalently, one projects `-r_0` onto `S(T)`:

    d^* = argmin_{d in S(T)} ||d - (-r_0)||.

Then

    d_* = ||r_0 + d^*||.

Thus the straight-line method is exact under its model: one convex hull construction and
one Euclidean projection solve the full problem. The reported closest time is recovered
geometrically from the location of the projection on the displacement cone.


Method 2: One fixed-rate turn, then straight
--------------------------------------------
The turn-aware method assumes each aircraft follows a deterministic heading profile:

    - start at heading h_0,
    - turn at fixed rate `turn_rate_deg_sec` toward target heading h_T,
    - stop turning once the target heading is reached,
    - continue straight on h_T thereafter.

Let Delta h be the signed heading change and let

    tau = |Delta h| / |turn_rate_deg_sec|

be the turn duration when `turn_rate_deg_sec != 0`. Write the unit heading vector as

    u(h) = (sin h, cos h).

For a fixed speed s, the aircraft position can be written in the form

    p(t; s) = p(0) + s b(t),

where the basis vector `b(t)` depends only on the heading profile, not on speed:

    b(t) = integral_0^t u(h(xi)) d xi.

Because the heading profile is piecewise simple, this integral is available in closed
form. During the turn,

    h(t) = h_0 + sigma |turn_rate_deg_sec| t,

with `sigma` the turn direction, so `b(t)` is obtained by analytically integrating the
rotating unit vector. After the turn, one appends the straight segment

    (t - tau) u(h_T).

This closed-form basis is what `_turn_displacement_basis` computes.

The key structural fact is that, at any fixed time t, position is affine in speed.
Therefore the relative-position set at that time is

    R(t) = r_0 + { s_A b_A(t) - s_B b_B(t)
                   : s_A in [s_A^-, s_A^+], s_B in [s_B^-, s_B^+] }.

Again this is the image of a speed rectangle under an affine map, so `R(t)` is a small
convex polygon: a point, segment, or parallelogram described by the four speed-corner
combinations. The exact worst-case distance at time t is then

    d(t) = min_{r in R(t)} ||r||,

which is computed by projecting the origin onto that polygon.

Thus, unlike the straight-line method, the difficulty is no longer the speed envelope at
a fixed time; that part remains exact and convex. The difficulty is minimising `d(t)`
over continuous time:

    d_* = min_{t in [0, T]} d(t).


Certified adaptive time search
------------------------------
The implementation does not march over a fixed time grid. Instead it evaluates `d(t)`
exactly at selected times and certifies whole time intervals as safe whenever possible.

Let `R(t)` be the fixed-time reachable relative-position hull and let

    d(t) = dist(0, R(t)).

Each hull corner is a trajectory of the form

    r_i(t) = r_0 + s_A b_A(t) - s_B b_B(t),

so its instantaneous speed is

    ||r_i'(t)|| = ||s_A u_A(t) - s_B u_B(t)||.

A valid Lipschitz constant for `d(t)` on an interval `I = [t_0, t_1]` is therefore

    L_I = sup_{t in I} max_i ||r_i'(t)||,

because the convex hull cannot move faster, in Hausdorff distance, than its fastest
corner and distance-to-set is 1-Lipschitz with respect to that motion.

This is tighter than the simpler global bound

    L_global = s_A^+ + s_B^+,

which remains available as an option but is no longer the default. The local
bound is preferred because it uses the known heading profiles on the interval instead of
assuming worst-case anti-parallel closing everywhere.

The practical reason this is cheap is that each heading profile is piecewise linear in
time: turn at fixed rate until a known completion time, then hold the target heading.
Hence the relative heading on any subinterval between turn-completion events is linear.
For one speed corner pair,

    ||s_A u_A(t) - s_B u_B(t)||^2
        = s_A^2 + s_B^2 - 2 s_A s_B cos(delta(t)),

with `delta(t)` the relative heading. Over a linear-heading subinterval, the maximum is
attained at an endpoint or at an internal anti-parallel crossing

    delta(t) = (2k + 1) pi.

So the interval-local bound can be computed exactly with a constant amount of work:
check the interval endpoints, split only at turn-completion events if needed, and test
whether an anti-parallel crossing occurs on each linear piece.

Once a Lipschitz constant `L_I` is available, an interval [t_0, t_1] with endpoint
distances `d_0 = d(t_0)` and `d_1 = d(t_1)` satisfies the lower bound

    d(t) >= (d_0 + d_1 - L_I (t_1 - t_0)) / 2.

Therefore:

    if (d_0 + d_1 - L_I (t_1 - t_0)) / 2 >= D,
    the entire interval is certified safe.

The algorithm starts with [0, T]. If that interval cannot be certified, it samples the
midpoint exactly, splits the interval in two, and repeats. Refinement continues until
each interval is either:

    - certified safe, or
    - smaller than a configured minimum interval width.

Intervals that remain uncertified at that minimum width are conservatively treated as
unsafe. This gives the central guarantee:

    the turn-aware method never returns "safe" unless all remaining time intervals have
    been certified safe under the model.

The reported `min_distance_m` and `closest_time_s` in the turning case are informative
diagnostics based on sampled points and interval certificates. The boolean safety result
is the primary mathematically guaranteed output.


Relationship between the two methods
------------------------------------
The straight-line method solves one global convex projection problem because the entire
reachable set over [0, T] collapses into a single displacement hull.

The turn-aware method solves a family of exact convex projection problems, one per
sampled time, because turning destroys the simple cone structure in time even though the
speed envelope remains convex at each fixed time.

So the distinction is:

    straight headings: exact in speed, exact in time,
    fixed-rate turns: exact in speed, conservative in time.


Structured hull optimization
----------------------------
Both methods share the same fixed-time geometric core:

    base + s_A a_basis - s_B b_basis,

with `s_A` and `s_B` drawn from closed speed intervals. The image of the speed
rectangle is therefore determined by just four speed-corner points.

This observation is now used explicitly in the implementation:

1. A shared helper constructs those four corner points for both
   - the straight-line displacement hull at `t = T`, and
   - the turn-aware relative-position hull at a fixed time `t`.
2. The hot-path hull construction for these tiny 4- and 5-point inputs uses a
   specialized small-set hull builder rather than the full generic monotone-chain
   implementation.
3. The generic `convex_hull` function is retained as a reference implementation and
   sanity oracle; tests compare the optimized structured path against it.

This optimization does not change the mathematics of the reachable sets. It only
exploits the fact that the relevant hulls in this module are tiny and highly
structured.


How this maps to functions
--------------------------
- `heading_to_unit_vector`: heading -> east/north direction.
- `latlon_to_local_xy`: latitude/longitude -> local east/north coordinates.
- `small_convex_hull`: optimized hull builder for the module's tiny structured inputs.
- `_speed_rectangle_corner_points`: shared affine speed-corner kernel.
- `compute_relative_velocity_hull`: straight-line reachable displacement hull over
  [0, T].
- `closest_point_on_convex_polygon`: Euclidean projection onto a convex polygon.
- `_closest_time_from_projection`: straight-line time recovery from the projected point.
- `catch_up_projection_interval`: exact straight-line safety test.
- `_turn_displacement_basis`: closed-form unit-speed displacement for a turn-then-straight
  heading law.
- `_interval_local_lipschitz_mps`: exact interval-local corner-speed supremum used as a
  turn-aware Lipschitz constant.
- `_relative_position_hull_at_time`: exact relative-position hull at one time.
- `_min_distance_to_relative_hull_at_time`: exact worst-case distance at one time.
- `_interval_distance_lower_bound`: Lipschitz certificate for a time interval.
- `catch_up_projection_interval_with_turns`: adaptive certified time search.


Safety interpretation
---------------------
- Straight-line method:
  - the full `(is_separated, min_distance_m, closest_time_s)` tuple is exact under the
    fixed-heading, bounded-constant-speed model.
- Turn-aware method:
  - exact in speed,
  - conservative in time,
  - and certified safe only when every remaining interval has been proved safe.
- The turn-aware API can optionally inflate the separation threshold by a conservative
  robustness buffer if one wants protection against speed variation during an active
  turn, beyond the core constant-speed model.
- If `is_separated` is `True` in the turn-aware method, the model certifies that no
  admissible speed realisation violates separation in the horizon considered.
- If `is_separated` is `False` in the turn-aware method, a separation loss is feasible
  in the modelled envelope or an interval could not be certified safe at the configured
  time resolution. With the optional robustness buffer enabled, `False` can also mean
  that the buffered threshold could not be certified even though the raw model remained
  clear of the nominal threshold.
- In the turn-aware method, `min_distance_m` and `closest_time_s` are diagnostics that
  summarize the most critical sampled point or interval certificate encountered.
- This is a deterministic reachability check, not a probability-of-conflict estimate.


Assumptions and limits
----------------------
- Horizontal 2-D kinematics only.
- Local tangent-plane projection; appropriate for local interactions, not long-haul
  geodesic fidelity.
- Symmetric bounded speed uncertainty, clipped at zero.
- No wind, acceleration, or stochastic dynamics.
- Straight-line mode assumes headings are constant over [0, T].
- Turn-aware mode assumes at most one fixed-rate turn per aircraft, from current
  heading to target heading, followed by straight flight.
- Turn-aware mode is conservative in time because it certifies intervals rather than
  solving the continuous-time minimum in closed form.

    Return the exact interval-local corner-speed supremum used as a Lipschitz constant.

    Motivation
    ----------
    A simple valid global bound is `a_max + b_max`, the largest possible closing rate
    across the whole horizon. That is always safe, but it is often too pessimistic
    because the two aircraft headings may be far from anti-parallel on most intervals.

    The distance-to-set function is 1-Lipschitz with respect to the Hausdorff motion of
    the reachable relative-position hull. Each hull corner moves with velocity

        v(t) = s_A u_A(t) - s_B u_B(t),

    so a valid interval-local Lipschitz constant for `d(t)` is

        sup_{t in [t0, t1]} max_corners ||v_corner(t)||.

    Because each heading profile is piecewise linear in time, the relative heading on
    each subinterval is linear. Therefore the supremum is attained at a subinterval
    endpoint or at an anti-parallel crossing, which makes the bound cheap to compute and
    straightforward to justify.

    """
    Evaluate horizontal separation when one or both aircraft may execute one turn.

    For turning cases, this function is exact in speed and conservative in time:
    at each sampled time it computes the exact reachable relative-position hull for
    the constant-speed envelope, then uses an adaptive time search with a Lipschitz
    bound to certify intervals as safe. Intervals that cannot be certified at the
    configured minimum width are treated as unsafe.

    For pairs where neither aircraft triggers the turn-aware path under
    `TURN_HEADING_EPS_DEG` and `TURN_RATE_EPS_DEG_PER_S`, it delegates directly to the
    exact straight-line `catch_up_projection_interval`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a_lat, a_lon : float
        Aircraft A current position.
    a_heading0_deg : float
        Aircraft A current heading (start of turn, or straight heading).
    a_target_heading_deg : float
        Aircraft A heading after turn (== heading0 if straight).
    a_speed_kt : float
        Aircraft A nominal speed in knots.
    a_turn_rate_deg_sec : float
        Aircraft A rate of turn in deg/s; 0.0 if straight.
    b_lat, b_lon : float
        Aircraft B current position.
    b_heading0_deg : float
        Aircraft B current heading.
    b_target_heading_deg : float
        Aircraft B heading after turn.
    b_speed_kt : float
        Aircraft B nominal speed in knots.
    b_turn_rate_deg_sec : float
        Aircraft B rate of turn in deg/s; 0.0 if straight.
    separation_threshold_m : float
        Required spacing in metres.
    speed_diff_kt : float
        Symmetric speed uncertainty in knots.
    projection_time_s : float
        Total projection horizon in seconds.
    use_interval_local_lipschitz : bool, optional
        If True, use the tighter interval-local Lipschitz bound derived from the
        commanded heading profiles. If False, use the simpler global bound
        `a_max + b_max`.
    turn_speed_schedule_uncertainty_kt : float, optional
        Optional robustness assumption for turning aircraft only. If positive, the
        function inflates the separation threshold by a conservative additive buffer
        corresponding to instantaneous in-turn speed variation within
        `nominal +/- turn_speed_schedule_uncertainty_kt`, even though the core reachable
        set still assumes one constant speed over the horizon. The buffer is zero for
        straight aircraft and is disabled by default.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[bool, float, float]
        `(is_separated, min_distance_m, closest_time_s)`.

        For turning cases, `min_distance_m` and `closest_time_s` are informative
        sampled/certified estimates. The primary contract is the boolean separation
        result, which is sound with respect to the modelled envelope. If
        `turn_speed_schedule_uncertainty_kt > 0`, the boolean decision also includes
        the requested robustness buffer, while the distance/time pair remains a raw
        diagnostic of the constant-speed geometry.

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm is:

    1. Evaluate the exact reachable relative-position hull at the interval endpoints.
    2. Use the endpoint distances and a Lipschitz constant to test whether the whole
       interval is already certified safe. By default this Lipschitz constant is the
       exact interval-local supremum of the corner relative speeds; the simpler global
       bound `a_max + b_max` remains available as an option.
    3. If not, split the interval at its midpoint, evaluate that fixed-time hull
       exactly, and continue with the two child intervals using an explicit DFS stack.
    4. Treat any interval shorter than `TURN_TIME_CERT_MIN_INTERVAL_S` that still
       cannot be certified as potentially unsafe.

    So the boolean return value is a certificate about the whole horizon, while the
    distance/time pair is a compact summary of the most critical sampled or certified
    point encountered during the search. The optional turn-speed-schedule buffer is
    applied by inflating the threshold, not by changing the reachable-set geometry.
