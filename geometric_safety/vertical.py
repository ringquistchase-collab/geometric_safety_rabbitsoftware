    required_gap_fl : float, optional

    rounded : int, optional
        Flight-level rounding step used before measuring the gap. The lower compared

    Returns
    -------
    float
        First time in seconds at which the remaining vertical bands are separated by

        `VERTICAL_OVERLAP_NEVER_RESOLVES_S` if they never resolve.

    Notes
    -----
    Band edges are piecewise linear in time, and their slopes can only change when one
    aircraft reaches its selected level. The function therefore checks at most two
    intervals and both possible vertical orderings. Exact edge checks use direct linear
    interpolation; rounded checks count the rounding-grid boundary events needed to
    satisfy the required gap.
    The model does not include vertical-rate uncertainty: because the same rate is used
    for both aircraft, callers using this as a safety filter should pass a conservative
    low value that all filtered aircraft are expected to meet or exceed.
