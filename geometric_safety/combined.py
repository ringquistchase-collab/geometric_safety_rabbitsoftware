    Evaluate straight-line lateral safety with an independent vertical overlap check.

    The vertical model returns the first time at which the remaining cleared-to-selected
    level bands are separated by `required_vertical_gap_fl`. The lateral solver is then
    only required to certify the interval before that vertical resolution time. If the
    bands are already resolved, the function returns safe with lateral diagnostics at
    `t=0`. If the bands never resolve, lateral safety is checked over the full projection
    horizon and `vertical_resolution_time_s` is `VERTICAL_OVERLAP_NEVER_RESOLVES_S`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a_lat, a_lon : float
        Aircraft A current position.
    a_heading : float
        Aircraft A heading in degrees.
    a_speed_kt : float
        Aircraft A nominal speed in knots.
    a_current_fl : float
        Aircraft A current flight level.
    a_selected_fl : float
        Aircraft A selected flight level.
    b_lat, b_lon : float
        Aircraft B current position.
    b_heading : float
        Aircraft B heading in degrees.
    b_speed_kt : float
        Aircraft B nominal speed in knots.
    b_current_fl : float
        Aircraft B current flight level.
    b_selected_fl : float
        Aircraft B selected flight level.
    separation_threshold_m : float
        Required lateral spacing in metres.
    speed_diff_kt : float
        Symmetric lateral speed uncertainty in knots.
    projection_time_s : float
        Total projection horizon in seconds.
    vertical_rate_fpm : float, optional
        Shared climb/descent rate magnitude in feet per minute, used for both
        aircraft. Negative values are treated as magnitudes.
    required_vertical_gap_fl : float, optional
        Required gap between the two remaining vertical bands, in flight levels.
    vertical_rounding_fl : int, optional
        Flight-level rounding step used before measuring the vertical gap. The lower
        compared level is rounded upward and the higher compared level downward.
        Values less than or equal to zero disable rounding and use exact band edges.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[bool, float, float, float]
        `(is_safe, lateral_min_distance_m, lateral_closest_time_s,
        vertical_resolution_time_s)`.

        `vertical_resolution_time_s` is the first time at which the vertical bands are
        resolved, or `VERTICAL_OVERLAP_NEVER_RESOLVES_S` if they never resolve. If the
        vertical bands are already resolved, the lateral distance/time pair describes
        the current geometry at `t=0`.

    Notes
    -----
    The vertical and lateral checks remain separate. The vertical model first determines
    when cleared-to-selected level bands resolve; the straight-line lateral solver then
    certifies only the period before that time. If the bands never resolve, the full
    lateral projection horizon is checked. Callers using this as a safety filter should
    pass a conservative low vertical rate that all filtered aircraft are expected to
    meet or exceed. The supplied lateral kinematics remain fixed during climb/descent;
    altitude-driven lateral speed changes are not modelled.

        Shared climb/descent rate magnitude in feet per minute, used for both

    required_vertical_gap_fl : float, optional
        Required gap between the two remaining vertical bands, in flight levels.
    vertical_rounding_fl : int, optional
        Flight-level rounding step used before measuring the vertical gap. The lower
        compared level is rounded upward and the higher compared level downward.
        Values less than or equal to zero disable rounding and use exact band edges.
    use_interval_local_lipschitz : bool, optional
        If True, use the tighter interval-local Lipschitz bound in the turn-aware
        lateral solver. If False, use its simpler global bound.
    turn_speed_schedule_uncertainty_kt : float, optional

        lateral distance/time pair is reported from the shortened turn-aware lateral
        horizon, or from `t=0` when the vertical bands are already resolved.

    Notes
    -----
    This function preserves the turn-aware lateral solver's conservative time
    certification. It only shortens the lateral horizon when the independent vertical
    timing check proves that the level bands resolve earlier. Callers using this as a
    safety filter should pass a conservative low vertical rate that all filtered
    aircraft are expected to meet or exceed. The supplied lateral kinematics remain
    fixed during climb/descent; altitude-driven lateral speed changes are not modelled.
