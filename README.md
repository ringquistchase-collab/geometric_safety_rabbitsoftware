# geometric_safety

Geometric reachability-based safety filtering for air traffic control.

## Overview

This package implements the Catch-Up Projection Interval (CUPI)
solver for lateral aircraft separation filtering. Given two aircraft
with known positions, headings, speed bounds, and optional turn
profiles, it determines whether they can possibly come within a
separation threshold over a projection horizon.

Two lateral solver variants:

- **Fixed heading** (`catch_up_projection_interval`) — exact
  geometric check for straight-line flight. Reduces the problem
  to one convex projection.
- **Turn-aware** (`catch_up_projection_interval_with_turns`) —
  handles one constant-rate turn per aircraft, then straight.
  Uses exact fixed-time hull evaluations with interval
  certification in time.

The solver uses only numpy and numba (no ATC domain dependencies).

### Additional vertical filtering

The package also includes a vertical cleared-band timing check, which
can be combined with the lateral solver. This vertical filtering is an
engineering extension in the package, not part of the accompanying
manuscript's CUPI method.

Vertical filtering (`time_to_vertical_overlap_resolution`) assumes
each aircraft climbs or descends from current flight level to selected
flight level at a fixed parameterized rate. It returns the first time
at which the two remaining cleared-to-selected level bands are
separated by the required vertical gap. The defaults are 1,000 ft/min
and 10 flight levels.

## Installation

Add to an existing uv project:

```bash
uv add geometric-safety \
    --git https://github.com/project-bluebird/geometric_safety.git
```

This adds two entries to your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
# in [project] dependencies
"geometric_safety>=0.1.0"

# in [tool.uv.sources]
geometric_safety = {
    git = "https://github.com/project-bluebird/geometric_safety"
}
```

To pin a specific commit or tag, pass `--rev`:

```bash
uv add geometric-safety \
    --git https://github.com/project-bluebird/geometric_safety.git \
    --rev <commit-or-tag>
```

For local development of this repo itself:

```bash
uv sync
```

## Usage

Turn-aware lateral check:

```python
from geometric_safety import catch_up_projection_interval_with_turns

is_separated, min_distance_m, closest_time_s = (
    catch_up_projection_interval_with_turns(
        a_lat=51.0, a_lon=-1.0,
        a_heading0_deg=0.0, a_target_heading_deg=270.0,
        a_speed_kt=340.0, a_turn_rate_deg_sec=1.5,
        b_lat=51.03, b_lon=-0.97,
        b_heading0_deg=90.0, b_target_heading_deg=90.0,
        b_speed_kt=340.0, b_turn_rate_deg_sec=0.0,
        separation_threshold_m=9260.0,  # 5 NMI
        speed_diff_kt=15.0,
        projection_time_s=900.0,
    )
)
```

Standalone vertical timing:

```python
from geometric_safety import (
    VERTICAL_OVERLAP_NEVER_RESOLVES_S,
    time_to_vertical_overlap_resolution,
)

vertical_resolution_time_s = time_to_vertical_overlap_resolution(
    a_current_fl=100.0,
    a_selected_fl=100.0,
    b_current_fl=100.0,
    b_selected_fl=120.0,
    vertical_rate_fpm=1000.0,
    required_gap_fl=10.0,
)

if vertical_resolution_time_s == VERTICAL_OVERLAP_NEVER_RESOLVES_S:
    ...
```

Combined lateral and vertical check:

```python
from geometric_safety import catch_up_projection_interval_with_turns_and_vertical

is_safe, min_distance_m, closest_time_s, vertical_resolution_time_s = (
    catch_up_projection_interval_with_turns_and_vertical(
        a_lat=51.0, a_lon=-1.0,
        a_heading0_deg=0.0, a_target_heading_deg=270.0,
        a_speed_kt=340.0, a_turn_rate_deg_sec=1.5,
        a_current_fl=100.0, a_selected_fl=100.0,
        b_lat=51.03, b_lon=-0.97,
        b_heading0_deg=90.0, b_target_heading_deg=90.0,
        b_speed_kt=340.0, b_turn_rate_deg_sec=0.0,
        b_current_fl=100.0, b_selected_fl=120.0,
        separation_threshold_m=9260.0,  # 5 NMI
        speed_diff_kt=15.0,
        projection_time_s=900.0,
        vertical_rate_fpm=1000.0,
        required_vertical_gap_fl=10.0,
    )
)
```

Use `catch_up_projection_interval_with_vertical` for the same combined
logic with the fixed-heading lateral solver.

For combined checks, lateral separation is only evaluated until the
vertical overlap resolves. If the vertical bands are already distinct
by the required gap, the result is safe immediately and the returned
lateral distance/time describe the current geometry at `t=0`. If they
never resolve, reported as `VERTICAL_OVERLAP_NEVER_RESOLVES_S`
(`-1.0`), the lateral solver checks the full projection horizon.

## Tests

## Relevant-aircraft visualiser

An interactive FastAPI interface for inspecting the CUPI geometry.
Supports both fixed-heading and turn-aware modes.

- **Fixed heading mode** — sweeps aircraft B's initial position
  across a configurable grid, showing the straight-line reachable
  envelopes over time.
- **Turn aware mode** — uses configured initial headings, target
  headings, turn rates, and optional turn-speed robustness margin.
  The detail view shows spatial trajectories, the relative hull at
  the selected time, and the distance-vs-time curve.

Turn-aware mode includes canned presets:

- Single-turn dodge
- Single-turn cut-in
- Mutual opening turns
- Mutual closing turns

```bash
uv sync --group apps
uv run uvicorn app:app --reload
